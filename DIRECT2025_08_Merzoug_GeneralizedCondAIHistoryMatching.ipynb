    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code implementing the generalized conditioning approach for history matching subsurface models using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and an Inference Network, as described in the associated research paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to train a primary GenAI model (specifically, a WGAN-GP) on **unconditioned** subsurface realizations. A separate, smaller Inference Network is then trained to map a latent space to the input space of the GenAI's generator such that the generated models are conditioned to specific well data (hard data and dynamic response). For history matching, the combined Inference Network and Generator are used within an Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantage of this approach is its **generalizability**. When new well data becomes available (e.g., due to new wells being drilled), only the computationally inexpensive Inference Network needs to be retrained, while the expensive primary GenAI model remains fixed. This significantly reduces computational costs compared to methods that require retraining the entire generative model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrates this workflow using a 3D fluvial channel reservoir case study. It simulates forward models using an external reservoir simulator (CMG) and assimilates dynamic production data (BHP) to update the latent space and generate history-matched reservoir models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is designed to be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment. It requires several Python libraries and external components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Python Libraries:** `numpy`, `multiprocessing`, `time`, `os`, `torch`, `torch.nn`, `pandas`, `sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error`, `pathlib`, `subprocess`, `scipy.interpolate`.\n",
    "2.  **External CMG Simulator:** The code interacts with the CMG IMEX simulator executable to run forward simulations. The path to the executable must be configured (`CMG` variable in `worker` function).\n",
    "3.  **`Sr3Reader.py` Module:** A custom Python module is required to read CMG simulation output files (`.sr3`). This module should contain `read_SR3` and `get_wells_timeseries` functions.\n",
    "4.  **Pre-trained Models:** The code loads a pre-trained Generator model (`checkpoint_epoch_*.pt`) and a pre-trained Inference Network model (`inference_net_epoch_*.pt`). These are assumed to be located in the `base_dir`.\n",
    "5.  **Simulation Template Files:** A base CMG input file template (`CMGBuilder00.dat`) and a file containing target days for interpolation (`Da2.csv`) are required in the `base_dir`.\n",
    "6.  **Truth Data:** CSV files containing the observed (truth) well production/pressure data (`Truth/Inj 1_CMG_aligned.csv`, `Truth/Prod 1_CMG_aligned.csv`, etc.) are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook defines and executes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Setup and Configuration:** Imports necessary libraries, defines the Generator and Inference Network architectures (based on Appendix A and C of the paper), loads pre-trained models, and sets up key parameters in a `CONFIG` dictionary (paths, network dimensions, ESMDA settings).\n",
    "2.  **Helper Functions:**\n",
    "    *   `load_generator`: Loads a PyTorch Generator model from a checkpoint.\n",
    "    *   `flatteningRealization`: Reshapes a 3D realization into a 1D array slice by slice and maps facies values (0, 1, 2) to permeability values (0.01, 150, 50) suitable for the simulator input.\n",
    "    *   `create_dat_file`: Writes the flattened permeability data to a `.dat` file with a CMG-specific header.\n",
    "    *   `modify_dat_file`: Modifies the main CMG input template to include the generated permeability file name.\n",
    "    *   `worker`: This is the core simulation worker function. It takes a single realization, prepares the necessary CMG input files (`.dat`), runs the CMG simulator using `subprocess`, waits for the simulation output (`.sr3`), reads the output using `Sr3Reader`, extracts well timeseries data, interpolates it to target days (from `Da2.csv`), saves the original and aligned timeseries, and cleans up intermediate files. It includes error handling for simulation failure and file processing issues.\n",
    "    *   `threshold_samples`: Applies a 0.5 threshold to the continuous generator output to obtain discrete facies values (0 or 1).\n",
    "3.  **ESMDA Execution:**\n",
    "    *   The main execution block (`if __name__ == '__main__':`) orchestrates the ESMDA process.\n",
    "    *   **Load and Standardize Observations:** Reads the truth well data and standardizes it using its mean and standard deviation. This standardization is crucial for the assimilation step.\n",
    "    *   **Initialize Ensemble:** Initializes the latent variable ensemble (`z_ensemble`) from a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "    *   **ESMDA Loop:** Iterates for the specified number of ESMDA steps (`n_iter`).\n",
    "        *   **Map Latent to Generator Input:** Uses the `inference_net` to transform `z_ensemble` into `w_ensemble`. (`w_ensemble = inference_net(z_ensemble)`)\n",
    "        *   **Generate Models:** Uses the `generator` to create subsurface realizations from `w_ensemble`. (`generated_batch = generator(w_ensemble)`)\n",
    "        *   **Threshold Models:** Applies `threshold_samples` to get discrete facies/permeability models.\n",
    "        *   **Run Simulations:** Executes the `worker` function for each ensemble member in parallel using `multiprocessing`.\n",
    "        *   **Collect and Standardize Results:** Reads the aligned well timeseries data saved by the `worker` functions and standardizes it using the *truth* data's mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "        *   **Compute MSE:** Calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the *original* truth data and the *original* (unstandardized) simulation results for diagnostic purposes. Stores this history. Includes backing up and cleaning up simulation outputs.\n",
    "        *   **Compute Kalman Gain:** Calculates the sample covariances (`Cov_zd_std`, `Cov_dd_std`) between the latent variable anomalies (`A_z`) and the standardized simulation data anomalies (`A_d_std`), and computes the Kalman Gain (`K_std`).\n",
    "        *   **Update Latent Ensemble:** Applies the ESMDA update formula to each member of the latent ensemble (`z_ensemble`), incorporating a noisy observation (`d_obs_std + eps_std`) and the simulated data (`d_model_std[i]`).\n",
    "        *   **Save Ensembles:** Saves the updated `w_ensemble` and `z_ensemble` to `.pt` files, appending the iteration number.\n",
    "    *   **Save MSE History:** After the loop, saves the recorded MSE history to a CSV file."

    "This section focuses on generating diverse geological realizations that honor observed data at specific well locations. It achieves this by training a separate **Inference Network** while using a pre-trained, **frozen** image **Generator**.\n",

    "2.  **Inference Network:** A new neural network (`InferenceNet`) is defined and trained. It takes simple random noise (`w`) as input and outputs a latent vector (`z`).\n",
    "3.  **Conditioning Data:** Observed geological values (`d_obs`) at specific well locations are loaded and used as the conditioning data.\n",
    "4.  **Training Objective (Cost Function):** The `InferenceNet` is trained to make the distribution of generated `z` vectors approximate the desired posterior distribution `P(z | d_obs)`. The loss function minimizes the difference between the approximate posterior `Q(z|w)` and the true posterior `P(z|d_obs)`. This involves three key components:\n",
    "    *   **Well Likelihood:** Measures how well the images produced by the *frozen* generator (using `z` from the Inference Net) match the observed data at the well locations. This term drives the network to generate data-consistent images.\n",
    "    *   **Gaussian Prior:** Encourages the latent vectors `z` to follow a standard Gaussian distribution, regularizing the latent space.\n",
    "    *   **Entropy Estimation:** Estimates the entropy of the generated `z` distribution using a k-nearest neighbor method. This term promotes diversity in the generated `z` vectors, ensuring a wide range of plausible realizations are sampled.\n",
    "5.  **Outcome:** After training, the `InferenceNet` can be used to sample new random noise vectors (`w`) and transform them into conditioned latent vectors (`z`). Feeding these `z` vectors into the frozen generator produces diverse geological realizations that are consistent with the observed well data."
