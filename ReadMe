The simulation files contain the base case simulation used for this system. 
it contains a permeability file and base simulation file. The content of permeabilty file changes during history matching for every ensemble


The Sr3Reader.py is a python script to read CMG simulator results 

The workflow is described in the DIRECT2025_08_Merzoug_GeneralizedCondAIHistoryMatching

The WGAN-GP (Generative AI model) is trained using the WGAN-GP.ipynb


Da.csv. is the interpolation for the days to ensure that the timesteps are aligned in all simulations
